## WORK EXPERIENCE

#### Team Leader at NTQ Solution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*December 2017 - Present*
>`Deliver outsourcing enterprise systems to the Japanese clients.`  
The projects I am involved in are short-term projects, requiring fast delivery and good quality.  
At present, my team have successfully delivered 3 projects.

#### .NET Developer at Massgenie
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*June 2016 - December 2017*
> `Building components responsible for helping massgenie.com interact with sellers and 3rd parties.`  
Three core components we build are:  
    1. Seller Portal at sellerportal.massgenie.com: Provides simple interfaces that help sellers interact with massgenie.com.  
    2. Public APIs: provides REST APIs for 3rd parties.  
    3. Background workers & services: help process data in background.

#### .NET Developer at BKIndex
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*June 2013 - June 2016*
> `Build small information management systems. Engage in all product life cycles.`  
    It's a great thing to say, most projects fail or fail after 1 years. These failures are my first experience in software development, which has caused me a lot of pain.
    But I learned a lot from them and became stronger today.

I am developer. Currently doing more in backend, focused in .NET.
